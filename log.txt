circle and square
=> commit 975f20a

1. How to store a list of different shape objects in a vector?
A vector canb only store object (or poiter to obejct) 
of the same type. We need to have a type that fits all.
-> convert to void *
2. How to convert void * to Circle * and Square *? How do we know
which type to convert to? Luckily each shape has a name!
-> static_cast<Circle *>(p)
3. write up the printShape function.
=> commit 2971044
Problem: now add a new class called Line.

1. add the class Line.
2. modify printShape function: add if check for line
=> commit

Look back:
1. The need to modify printShape every time you add a new type
2. Much duplicated code
